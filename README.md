# Functional Component Contact List

### Let's create a contact list using functional components and mapping.

Here is what the finished application will look like:

So let's break this down:

1) You have a list of contacts hard coded in `/src/data/contact.json`

2) You need to bring this data into your `App.js`

2) You will have to create a new component to hold each individual contact ( *hint* you probably want to use Map here)

3) At the very least for styling your app should be in a list of contacts down the center of the page with the photo in a circle on the left and the information on the right

4) **Bonus!!!** If you want to go above and beyond create the layout shown in the GIF on this page that looks like a phone screen and only shows a few contacts at a time

5) **Ultra Bonus!!!** Recreate the mockup shown below in React and have the contacts render on the screen!


#### Have Fun!!!
